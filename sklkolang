Hi!
I am Eric Gabriel L. Perez, a second year Electronics Engineering student from the University of Santo Tomas.
As time goes by, I learn a lot of new things. Now, I do graphic design and lay-outing as a way to destress myself.
During my high school days, I have become a part of the lay-out team of several school publications.
I do not have much to say about myself because I'm still learning things I like to do.
That is all. Thank you.
